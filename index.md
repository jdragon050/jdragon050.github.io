## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 2
What I enjoyed on this lab is that I calculated the number of days between two given dates with the use of the gregorian calendar. All while using Fliegel and Van Flandern algorithm to convert dates to Julian days and computing the date difference using only int types and writing function definitions for Julian Day, Date Difference, and print date.

* Lab 9, part 1
I enjoyed working on Lab 9, part 1 because the lab focused on the Olympic judge average which calculates the Olympic average by eliminating least and greatest scores. We got to experience it by using command line arguments, converting scores to floating-point precision, and ensuring the program gracefully handles various scenarios, such as too few arguments or invalid score formats.

* Lab 11, part 2
I enjoyed working on Lab 11, part 2 with my partners because we got to help design a hi-Lo game which is a fun number guessing game that I personally enjoy. We had to check for command line arguments and create gamestate objects along with looping until the game ends. Then the end message prints out whether the player won or lost.
